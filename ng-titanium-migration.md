### Overview

The NG Titanium client is the latest evolution in Servoy's app deployment technology. With this offering, the NG Client gets a brand new engine, allowing Servoy applications to stay up-to-date without having to rewrite or undergo a major refactor. This guide is intended for developers that have NG Client applications that they'd like to migrate to NG Titanium.

### Getting Started

**Update Servoy Developer**
It is recommended to [download](https://servoy.com/download) and install the latest stable version of Servoy Developer. Use`Version 2022.3.x` at a minimum.

Be sure to commit any outstanding changes or back up your workspace. It could also be a good idea to move to a new branch in your repository as you work through the changes.

**Update Component Packages**
Next, you will need to update component packages to endure that they are Titanium-compatible. In Servoy Developer, open the Servoy Package Manager (SPM) and review the Components and Services that are in use. You will likely be updating from a semantic version to a year-based version. 

For example, updating grid components: `NG-Grids 2.9.1` --> `NG-Grids 2022.3.1`
